Ford made these automatic transmission with some level of care & some level of crack in their systems. This Projects goal is to have a fully opensource diy way to control the 4 and 5 speed transmission Ford/Mazda/Lincon used in a lot of FR & F4 vehlicles from 1995-2011(ie, Ranger/B0000, Explorer/Mountaineer, Aerostar, & Many More). The main diffrences between these modles is that the R44E are a lighter duty unit, and the controler(The 4 and 5 Speed are mechanicly identical only the controler is diffrent).

Curently allowing for full manual control is the main goal, but auto mode is a planned feature. 
For those unlucky enough to have the 4 speed this should also unlock the 3rd gear ratio that is found on the 5 speed unit.

My personal goal for this project is to make a cheap, and nocompromise system to control these abundent automatics.
